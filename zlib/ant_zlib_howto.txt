ANT_ZLIB_HOWTO.TXT
------------------
To get ZLIB built for ANT (under Windows) do the following:

1. Download zlib from http://www.zlib.net/ I use version 1.2.3 (dated July 18, 2005)

2. Decompress into ant\zlib\zlib-1.2.3

3. Change directory to ant\zlib\zlib-1.2.3

4. make -f ..\makefile.msc

This will create ant\zlib\zlib-1.2.3\zlib.lib.  Now tell ANT that we have ZLIB

5. set ANT_HAS_ZLIB=$(TRUE) in the ant\makefile

you can now build ANT
